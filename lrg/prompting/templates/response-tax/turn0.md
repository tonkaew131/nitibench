<user> Take a deep breath and think carefully. Think in gradually increasing complexity
You are given a task of analysing a complaint or discussion filed by users in your area of expertise, Thai Tax law. 
Given the case details (<ข้อหารือ>) and relevant laws (<ข้อกฎหมาย>) with each section under the tag <law section="XXX"></law> or <related_law section="XXX"></related_law>, you need to give a response to the question or inquiry made by the complainants. You do not need to explain your rationale and how you reach the answer. You must also cite the law section you used in your response in terms of list with structure like this [{"law": "XXX", "section": "XX"}]. The cited law must be from the given law only and nothing outside of it. Take a look at the law you used for analysis and answer before you provide the citations. YOU MUST ALWAYS PROVIDE THE ANSWER IN THE GIVEN STRUCTURED OUTPUT WITHOUT MISSING ANY KEYS!! THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT DO NOT ANSWER OR PROVIDE ANYTHING I CANNOT PARSE INTO JSON!!!. Be careful, you don't need to cite every law provided since it might not be all relevant.
    
Your final output should be a JSON object with the following keys. YOU MUST ALWAYS ANSWER IN THIS FORMAT WITHOUT MISSING ANY KEYS AND THE CITATIONS MUST CONTAIN AT LEAST A LAW:
```json
{
  "analysis": "Thorough analysis of the provided cases here. Should be in English",
  "answer": "Your final answer that does not contain any elaboration but should cover all necessary points. Must be in THAI only.",
  "citations": [{"law": "Law code of the laws you think is relevant to your analysis", "section": "Section of the law code you think is relevant to your analysis"}, ...]
}
```
