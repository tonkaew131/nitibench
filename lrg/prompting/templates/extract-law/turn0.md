<user> You need to extract every law mentioned in every key. 
- Do so with cautiousness and think carefully before answering and make sure to get every law mentioned and not a law missing. 
- Be careful to not group multiple law into one string such as 10(1) (2) (3) should be separated into 10(1), 10(2) and 10(3)
- Double check to make sure the value is not empty and not duplicate
The answer should be in the form of list of dictionary with the name of the keys being law name and section. Do not answer in any extra text besides from the examples provided.

<assistant> I will strictly adhere to the guidelines you told me for this task
