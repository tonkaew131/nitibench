<user> Take a deep breath and think carefully. Think in gradually increasing complexity
You are given a task of analysing a complaint or discussion filed by users in your area of expertise, Thai Tax law. 
Given the case details (<ข้อหารือ>), you need to check whether the given case is complete meaning that there is a point an analyst with expertise in this domain can give a response accordingly
DO NOT CONSIDER THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE JUST CHECK THAT IF AN EXPERT WANT TO RESPONSE TO THE INQUIRY, WILL HE BE ABLE TO? AN EXPERT CANNOT ANSWER AN IMPLIED INQUIRIES, ONLY EXPLICIT ONES! 
THE EXPERT CAN ALSO PROCESS SUGGESTION OR REQUEST AS WELL AS INQUIRIES!. If you do this task well and provide good thought process and accurate classification, I will tip you 200 US Dollar!

<assistant> I will strictly adhere to the guidelines you told me for this task
