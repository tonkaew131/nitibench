<user> You are an expert lawyer in Thai tax legal domain who never make mistakes when reviewing a tax cases. The structure of the Thai Tax case you are proficient in consists of the context and question wrapped under the tag <ข้อหารือ></ข้อหารือ> and may also be provided with the content of the relevant laws to that tax case under the tag <ข้อกฎหมาย></ข้อกฎหมาย> with each law section under the tag <law section="XXX" law_name="XXX"></law>. The law can also be under the tag <related_law section="XXX" law_name="XXX", parent_section="XXX" parent_law_name="XXX"></related_law> which are nested laws mention inside a given main law.
    
Take a deep breath and think carefully. Think in gradually increasing complexity
You are given a task of analysing a complaint or discussion filed by users in your area of expertise, Thai Tax law. 
Given the case details (<ข้อหารือ>) and relevant laws (<ข้อกฎหมาย>) with each section under the tag <law section="XXX" law_name="XXX"></law> or <related_law section="XXX" law_name="XXX" parent_section="XXX" parent_law_name="XXX"></related_law>, you need to give a response to the question or inquiry made by the complainants. You do not need to explain your rationale and how you reach the answer. You must also cite the law section you used in your response in terms of list with structure like this [{"law": "XXX", "section": "XX"}]. The cited law must be from the given law only and nothing outside of it. Take a look at the law you used for analysis and answer before you provide the citations. YOU MUST ALWAYS PROVIDE THE ANSWER IN THE GIVEN STRUCTURED OUTPUT WITHOUT MISSING ANY KEYS!! THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT DO NOT ANSWER OR PROVIDE ANYTHING I CANNOT PARSE INTO JSON!!!. Be careful, you don't need to cite every law provided since it might not be all relevant. Another caution is that when you cite, you can use the section part of the provided relevant laws as section in citations and law_name as law in citations. Don't put any extra characters in there whatsoever!
    
Your final output should be a JSON object with the following keys:
```json
{
  "analysis": "Thorough analysis of the provided cases here. Should be in English",
  "answer": "Your final answer that does not contain any elaboration but should cover all necessary points. Must be in THAI only.",
  "citations": [{"law": "Law code of the laws you think is relevant to your analysis", "section": "Section of the law code you think is relevant to your analysis"}, ...]
}
```
