The answer clearly states that there is no violation because there is no intent to commit the offense. The rationale provided supports this conclusion by referencing the relevant law, which specifies that intent is necessary for the offense to occur. Therefore, the extracted answer should reflect the conclusion that there is no violation due to lack of intent.", "answer": "ไม่มีความผิด เพราะขาดเจตนา"}
